Document Title: Northwind Health — Customer Ops Knowledge Base (v1.7)
Last updated: 2026-01-05
Audience: Support agents, customer success, and operations
1) Company & Products
Northwind Health provides a care coordination platform used by outpatient clinics. The platform has three modules:

Intake: online forms, eligibility checks, insurance capture, and appointment requests.
CareHub: tasks, care plans, referrals, and secure messaging.
Insights: dashboards for no-show rates, referral leakage, and care gap tracking.

Clinics typically use Intake and CareHub daily. Insights is used weekly by managers.
2) Common Customer Questions (FAQ)
Q: How long does it take to onboard a new clinic?
A: Typical onboarding is 2–4 weeks depending on EHR integration, SSO (single sign-on) setup, and data migration.
Q: What is the fastest onboarding path?
A: Use CSV patient import and password-based login first, then add SSO and EHR integration later.
Q: Does the system support multiple locations?
A: Yes. A single tenant can support multiple locations with location-based roles and reporting filters.
Q: Can patients message providers?
A: Yes in CareHub secure messaging. Patients can message a care team inbox; clinics can configure auto-responses outside business hours.
3) Pricing & Packaging (Customer-safe summary)
Northwind Health pricing has two dimensions:

Base subscription by clinic size (small, mid, enterprise)
Module add-ons (CareHub, Insights, premium integrations)

Discounts:

Annual prepay may qualify for a discount.
Multi-clinic contracts may qualify for tiered pricing.
Important: Sales owns final pricing approval. Support should not quote numbers; refer to the account owner.

4) Support & Escalation
Support hours are 8am–8pm ET, Monday–Friday (excluding US holidays).
Severity levels:

SEV-1 (Critical): System outage or widespread inability to access core workflows (login failures affecting many users, major API outage). Response target: 15 minutes.
SEV-2 (High): Major feature impairment with workaround (appointments not syncing for one clinic). Response target: 1 hour.
SEV-3 (Normal): Standard issues and “how-to” questions. Response target: 4 business hours.

Escalation rules:

Escalate to Engineering if reproducible and affects production workflows.
Escalate to Security if suspected PHI exposure, suspicious login patterns, or unusual data exports.

5) Security & Compliance Overview
Northwind Health is designed for healthcare environments:

Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest.
Role-based access control is enforced at the tenant and location level.
Audit logs track logins, exports, and record access.

PHI handling:
If a customer reports potential PHI exposure, do not request screenshots containing PHI. Ask for:

affected clinic name and tenant ID
approximate time window
user emails involved (if known)
what they believe was exposed (messages, patient profile, exports)

Then escalate to Security immediately.
6) Integration Notes (EHR + SSO)
EHR integrations: The platform supports HL7 interfaces for ADT and scheduling updates, and an API-based integration for select EHR vendors. Common delays are caused by:

clinic IT firewall rules blocking outbound webhooks
mismatched patient identifiers between systems
incomplete mapping for appointment statuses (e.g., “Arrived”, “Checked-In”, “In Room”)

SSO setup: SAML 2.0 is supported. Most SSO issues come from:

incorrect ACS URL configured in the IdP
missing email attribute mapping
clock drift causing assertion expiry

7) Recent Incident Summary (for retrieval testing)
Incident INC-20491 (Resolved):
On 2025-12-11, some clinics experienced delayed task notifications in CareHub. Root cause was a queue backlog after a deployment. Mitigation was to scale workers and replay events. No data loss occurred; notifications were delivered late.
Incident INC-20503 (Resolved):
On 2025-12-19, a subset of users could not export reports from Insights. The export service returned intermittent 503 errors. A hotfix updated retry logic and improved service health checks.
8) Internal How-To: Troubleshooting Login Failures
When a user reports they “can’t log in,” identify which case applies:

Password login: verify email, check lockout status, confirm password reset email delivery.
SSO login: confirm they used the correct SSO URL, verify IdP status, validate SAML attributes.
Multi-location user: ensure they have at least one active role assignment.

If multiple users at the same clinic are impacted, treat as SEV-2 or SEV-1 depending on scope.
